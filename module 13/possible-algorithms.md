# Possible Algorithms

### 1. Graph Algorithms
- Given that you've described the problem space as a "forest," graph algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) can be employed to traverse through the trees and decide which paths to take.

### 2. Optimization Algorithms
- Your problem is essentially an optimization problemâ€”you want to maximize the "health score" given a set of constraints (e.g., limited resources). Therefore, you might look into 
- algorithms like:
    - Genetic Algorithms
    - Particle Swarm Optimization
    - Simulated Annealing

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- You could use a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm like Q-Learning to make the allocation more dynamic and adaptable over time. RL would allow your system to learn the best actions to take (i.e., which trees to allocate resources to) to maximize some notion of cumulative reward (i.e., the "health score").

### 4. Multi-Objective Optimization
- Since you're interested in fairness, a multi-objective algorithm like Pareto Optimization could help balance multiple conflicting goals (e.g., maximize health score while minimizing inequality among trees).

### 5. Game Theory
- Given that you drew parallels to government resource allocation, you might also consider game-theoretical algorithms that aim to find equilibriums in such settings. Algorithms based on the Nash Equilibrium could be useful.

### 6. Decision Trees & Random Forests
- These could be interestingly meta, but you could actually use decision tree algorithms to decide which "tree" to allocate resources to, based on a set of features or criteria at each step.

### 7. Dynamic Programming
- If your problem can be broken down into overlapping sub-problems, algorithms like Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra's could be adapted for resource allocation while keeping an eye on the "health score."
