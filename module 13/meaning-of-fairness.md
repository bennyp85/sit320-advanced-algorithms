### What Does 'Fairness' Mean?

In general terms, fairness can relate to equitable distribution of resources, opportunities, or treatment across a diverse set of individuals or groups. However, fairness can be subjective and context-dependent, so it's crucial to define it explicitly for your project.

Here are some conceptual frameworks to think about:

1. **Equality vs. Equity**: In equality, everyone gets the same resources, while in equity, resources are distributed based on individual needs or circumstances. Which one aligns with your project?
  
2. **Meritocracy**: Here, resources are allocated based on performance, merit, or contribution to the system. Does this resonate with you?
  
3. **Needs-Based**: Resources are distributed based on specific requirements or vulnerabilities. This could be useful in a healthcare context.

4. **Market-Driven**: The "invisible hand" of the market decides the fair allocation, often based on supply and demand dynamics. Is this relevant to your scope?

5. **Rule-Based**: Allocation is determined by a set of predefined rules or criteria that aim to be impartial.

6. **Utilitarian**: The focus is on maximizing overall happiness or utility, possibly at the expense of individual fairness.

### Ethical Considerations

Since you're committed to maximizing happiness on a societal scale, perhaps a utilitarian or needs-based model would align well with your goals. Remember to consider potential biases in the data and the ethical implications of your algorithm, as fairness is often intertwined with social justice concerns.

### Inspirational Figures and Fairness

- **John Nash's** equilibrium theory could offer a mathematical way to look at fairness.
- **Eliezer Yudkowsky's** work on rationality and ethics might provide a philosophical underpinning for defining fairness.
- **Andrej Karpathy's** work in AI could be inspiring in terms of how machine learning models could be trained to learn 'fair' behavior.

### Questions for Reflection

1. What are the variables or criteria you consider in your definition of 'fairness'?
2. Are there any conflicts between different fairness criteria, and how do you plan to resolve them?
3. Is your approach to fairness scalable and generalizable across different contexts or domains?
