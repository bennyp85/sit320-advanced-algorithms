### Information Gathering for Research Proposal: Designing Fair Resource Allocation Algorithms

#### 1. Domain Selection
- Define the specific domain for resource allocation (e.g., healthcare, education).
- Understand the unique challenges and constraints within this domain.

#### 2. Dataset Information
- Identify and access the public dataset you'll be using.
- Analyze the structure, contents, and relevance of the dataset to your research question.

#### 3. Existing Solutions
- Review literature on existing algorithms and methods used in resource allocation.
- Identify gaps or areas of improvement, focusing on fairness.

#### 4. Algorithm Selection
- Choose the specific data structures and algorithms to explore.
- Gather relevant literature, tutorials, or examples related to these algorithms.

#### 5. Fairness Metrics
- Define and understand the criteria or metrics to measure fairness in allocation.
- Review existing metrics or propose new ones that align with your research question.

#### 6. Ethical Considerations
- Explore the ethical implications of fair resource allocation.
- Understand the broader societal impact of your research.

#### 7. Technical Requirements
- Determine the software, tools, or platforms you'll need for implementation.
- Plan for any preprocessing or transformation required for the dataset.

#### 8. Project Timeline
- Develop a realistic timeline for your research, including milestones and deadlines.

#### 9. Collaboration & Support
- Identify potential collaborators, mentors, or advisors.
- Determine the support or resources available within your institution or network.

#### 10. Writing & Presentation
- Gather guidelines or templates for writing the proposal.
- Prepare for potential presentations or defenses related to the proposal.

### Notes
- Keep detailed notes of your findings, decisions, and thought processes.
- Organize your research materials, code, and writings in a systematic way for easy access.

### Important Dates
- Mark any deadlines or important dates related to the proposal submission, review, or implementation.
