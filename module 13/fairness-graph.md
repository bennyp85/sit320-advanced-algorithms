# Fairness Graph/Algorithm Idea

## Concept
- **Health Score**: Starting point (e.g., 100)
- **Resources Score**: Number of nodes you can visit
- **Forest (Graph)**: Composed of good and bad trees
- **Goal**: Keep health score close to 100

## Application
- Represents how a government might allocate resources to various sectors (trees).

## Questions to Explore
1. **Tree Nodes**: Monolithic entities or sub-components?
2. **Resource Quantification**: Constant or variable?
3. **Decision Mechanism**: Part of the algorithm or external?
4. **Dynamic or Static**: Does the forest change over time?
5. **Feedback Mechanism**: Learning from past allocations?
6. **Constraints**: Any limits on resource allocation?
7. **Edge Cases**: Penalties or rewards at health score bounds?
8. **Fairness Metric**: Metrics for evaluating fairness.

## Suggestions for Improvement
1. **Global and Local Scores**: Both could exist for each tree.
2. **Multi-objective Optimization**: Balance maintaining health score and other objectives.
3. **Incorporate Time**: Make the health scores dynamic.
4. **Learning Algorithm**: Use machine learning for better future decisions.
5. **Ethical Weighing**: Account for societal impact in the algorithm.
