## Algorithmic Pathways for Fairness in Resource Allocation

Given your background and the aim to focus on fairness in resource allocation, here are some compelling pathways:

### 1. Graph Algorithms
- **Consideration**: Extending Dijkstra's algorithm to account for fairness in resource distribution.
  
### 2. Dynamic Programming
- **Consideration**: Extending the knapsack problem where each item's "value" is a function of how it contributes to overall fairness.

### 3. Greedy Algorithms
- **Consideration**: Extending a greedy approach to allocate resources incrementally while considering fairness and health metrics.

### 4. Linear Programming
- **Consideration**: Adding constraints to a linear programming model like the simplex algorithm that factor in fairness and health.

### 5. Design Principles & Patterns
- **Consideration**: Incorporating design principles like Dependency Inversion and patterns like Factory and Observer for modular design, although these are not algorithms per se.

### Questions for Further Clarification
1. What is your specific definition of "fairness" in this context?
2. Is the "forest" you described static or dynamic? Do the health scores of individual trees change over time?
3. What constraints are you considering? Fixed resources? Time?
