# module three tasks

## Task 0: Overview of Learning
- Start with a comprehensive review of the course materials from lectures, seminar notes, content on Cloud Deakin, and any related discussions with the Unit Chair, tutors, and peers.
- Conduct additional research on the internet or in the library to further deepen your understanding.
- Utilize chatGPT to further expand your knowledge and understanding. **Make sure to document any prompts used during these interactions.**
- Compile all the information and summarize what you have learned in this module.

## Task 1: Design Pattern for Multiple Games
- Review the tic-tac-toe algorithm and the stable design program that you built in modules 1 and 2.
- Imagine a client scenario and use it to guide your thinking and development. 
    - The client is requesting a framework for **multiple games (tic-tac-toe, backgammon, chess)**, with both a minimax solution and a reinforcement learning algorithm solution.
    - Sketch out an initial **class diagram** for the framework using your understanding of factory patterns. Consider how you can design it to be expandable for additional games and algorithms in the future.
    - After finalizing the class diagram, proceed with coding the basic skeleton of the application. You're not required to implement strategies for backgammon or chess yet.

## Task 2: Understanding of Observer Pattern
- Download the Python code for the observer pattern from the module's code section.
- Start by reading and analyzing the code thoroughly to **understand its structure, operations, and logic**.
- Once you have a good understanding, consider one of the following approaches:
    - **Modify the code to demonstrate an understanding of its logic and functions**.
    - Think of and **document new use cases and test cases** for the code.
    - Find and record any **limitations of the code**.
    - Write a succinct **summary of the operations and behavior** of the code.
