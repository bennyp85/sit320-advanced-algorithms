# Glossary of Terms

1. **Algorithm**
   - An algorithm is a well-defined sequence of steps that provides a solution for a specific type of problem.
   - Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and programming as they provide the backbone for any non-trivial program.
   - Some common examples of algorithms include sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and numerical algorithms for scientific computing.

2. **Design Pattern**
   - Design patterns represent best practices and are solutions to common problems that occur in software design. These are not code per se, but are templates on how to solve problems.
   - They can speed up the development process by providing tested and optimized development paradigms.
   - Examples include the Factory Pattern, Singleton, and Observer Pattern among many others.

3. **Factory Pattern**
   - The Factory Pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
   - It provides a simple way of extending the program's functionality by substituting different factory classes.
   - This pattern allows the subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

4. **Class Diagram**
   - Class diagrams are a type of structural UML diagram that depict the classes within a system and the relationships between those classes.
   - They show properties and operations of a class and also the relationships the class shares with other classes.
   - Class diagrams are used for a variety of purposes, including both conceptual/domain modeling and detailed design modeling.

5. **Minimax Algorithm**
   - The Minimax algorithm is used in game theory to make decision in a multi-agent environment, typically turn-based games, where the result of a game is a win, lose, or draw outcome.
   - It works by simulating all possible game scenarios and then making an optimal move based on the best possible outcome.
   - The algorithm assumes perfect play, meaning it expects that the opponent will also be using the minimax algorithm to determine their moves.


6. **Reinforcement Learning** - A type of machine learning where an agent learns to behave in an environment, by performing certain actions and observing the results/results.

7. **Software Framework** - An abstraction in which common code providing generic functionality can be selectively overridden or extended by user code providing specific functionality.

8. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** - A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures.

9. **Unit Testing** - A level of software testing where individual units/components of a software are tested to validate that each performs as expected.

10. **Functional Programming** - A programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

11. **Python** - An interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its easy readability with great design principles.

12. **Observer Pattern** - A software design pattern where an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes.

13. **Use Case** - A description of a system's behaviour as it responds to requests that start in the world of the user.

14. **Test Case** - A set of conditions or variables under which a tester determines whether a system under test satisfies requirements or works correctly.

15. **Code Refactoring** - The process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behaviour, in order to improve internal code structure.

16. **Dependency Injection** - A technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on, reducing hard-coded dependencies and making it possible to change them, whether at run-time or compile-time.

17. **Version Control** - The management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information.

18. **Exception Handling** - The process of responding to the occurrence, during computation, of exceptions â€“ anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring special processing.

19. **API (Application Programming Interface)** - A set of rules that allows programs to communicate with each other, defining the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats to use, etc.

20. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** - A software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.
