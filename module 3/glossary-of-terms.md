# Glossary of Terms

1. **Algorithm** - A precise sequence of instructions or set of rules for performing computation or solving a specific task.

2. **Design Pattern** - A reusable solution to a common problem in software design. It's a template used to solve problems that can occur in many different situations.

3. **Factory Pattern** - A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

4. **Class Diagram** - A type of UML diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, and the relationships among the classes.

5. **Minimax Algorithm** - A decision-making algorithm, typically used in a turn-based, two-player games. The goal of the Minimax algorithm is to find the optimal move for a player assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally.

6. **Reinforcement Learning** - A type of machine learning where an agent learns to behave in an environment, by performing certain actions and observing the results/results.

7. **Software Framework** - An abstraction in which common code providing generic functionality can be selectively overridden or extended by user code providing specific functionality.

8. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** - A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures.

9. **Unit Testing** - A level of software testing where individual units/components of a software are tested to validate that each performs as expected.

10. **Functional Programming** - A programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

11. **Python** - An interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its easy readability with great design principles.

12. **Observer Pattern** - A software design pattern where an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes.

13. **Use Case** - A description of a system's behaviour as it responds to requests that start in the world of the user.

14. **Test Case** - A set of conditions or variables under which a tester determines whether a system under test satisfies requirements or works correctly.

15. **Code Refactoring** - The process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behaviour, in order to improve internal code structure.

16. **Dependency Injection** - A technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on, reducing hard-coded dependencies and making it possible to change them, whether at run-time or compile-time.

17. **Version Control** - The management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information.

18. **Exception Handling** - The process of responding to the occurrence, during computation, of exceptions â€“ anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring special processing.

19. **API (Application Programming Interface)** - A set of rules that allows programs to communicate with each other, defining the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats to use, etc.

20. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** - A software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.
