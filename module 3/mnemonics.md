# Mnemonics

1. **Algorithm**
   - Mnemonic: "**A**ll **L**ogical **G**oats **O**rder **R**eally **I**nteresting **T**hings **H**astily **M**unching."
   - The mnemonic is a reminder that Algorithms are **A**bout **L**ogical **G**uidelines that **O**rder tasks into **R**ealizable, **I**ncremental steps to solve problems (**T**hings) effectively and efficiently (**H**astily), and are **M**ainstay of programming.

2. **Design Pattern**
   - Mnemonic: "**D**on't **E**ver **S**top **I**nvestigating **G**reat **N**ew **P**ractices, **A**ccept **T**he **T**ested **E**fficient **R**outines **N**ow."
   - This mnemonic reminds you that Design Patterns are **D**ocumented solutions that should not stop you from **I**nvestigating other possibilities, but they are **G**reat **N**ew ways to solve common problems using **T**ested, **E**fficient **R**outines that are widely accepted (**N**ow) in the programming community.

3. **Factory Pattern**
   - Mnemonic: "**F**ind **A** **C**lass, **T**weak **O**bject **R**eality, **Y**ield **P**erfect **A**ltered **T**hing **T**o **E**xplore **R**ealms **N**ew."
   - This mnemonic is a reminder that the Factory Pattern allows you to "**F**ind" a "**C**lass", "**T**weak" the object it creates (its "**R**eality"), and "**Y**ield" a new object that's "**P**erfect" for your specific needs. This allows you to "**E**xplore **R**ealms **N**ew" in terms of object creation.

4. **Class Diagram**
   - Mnemonic: "**C**lear **L**akes **A**re **S**o **S**erene, **D**ucks **I**n **A** **G**roup **R**emain **A**ligned **M**ajestically."
   - The mnemonic serves as a reminder that Class Diagrams provide a "**C**lear" and "**S**erene" view (like a lake) of the system, showing how different classes (**D**ucks **I**n **A** **G**roup) are related and how they remain "**A**ligned" in the overall structure (**M**ajestically).

5. **Minimax Algorithm**
   - Mnemonic: "**M**y **I**ncredible **N**eighbor **I**nvests **M**oney, **A**lways **X**eroxes **A**ll **L**egal **G**ains, **O**ptimizes **R**evenue **I**n **T**imes **H**ard **M**ost."
   - The Mnemonic should help you remember that the Minimax Algorithm is about "**M**aking **I**deal choices" in a competitive environment (like **I**nvesting **M**oney). It involves looking at all possibilities (**A**lways **X**eroxing **A**ll **L**egal **G**ains) to find the optimal move, even in the worst-case scenario (**R**evenue **I**n **T**imes **H**ard **M**ost).
