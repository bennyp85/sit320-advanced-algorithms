# Roadmap that aligns with good development practices
---

## Phase 1: Research and Understanding
**Understand Q-Learning**: Before diving into coding, make sure you understand the Q-Learning algorithm, its equations, and **how it differs from Value Iteration**. This will help you understand what you're coding.
**Study Similar Implementations**: Look at existing Q-Learning implementations, especially those related to Tic-Tac-Toe or similar games. This can give you **insights into how to structure your code**.

## Phase 2: Design and Planning
**Identify Components**: You've already done this by outlining your class and methods. Make sure you **understand what each method will do**.
**Pseudocode**: Write pseudocode for the main algorithm and its sub-components. This will serve as your **blueprint while coding**.
**Data Structures**: Decide on the **data structures** you'll use to store the Q-values, states, and actions.
**Initialization**: Plan how you'll initialize your Q-values. Will you start with all zeros, random numbers, or some other heuristic?
**Exploration vs Exploitation**: Decide on a **strategy** for balancing exploration and exploitation (e.g., Îµ-greedy).

## Phase 3: Pre-Implementation
**Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for the smaller components. This will **save you debugging time** later.
**Version Control**: If not already doing so, use a version control system like Git to manage your code.

## Phase 4: Implementation
**Start Small**: Implement and test the **smallest** components first. For example, you might start with initializeQValues and chooseAction.
**Iterative Testing**: After implementing a component, test it. **Don't wait** to write all the code before you start testing.

**Logging: Implement logging to track the agent's decisions, Q-value updates, and rewards. This will help in debugging.**

## Phase 5: Debugging and Optimization
**Debug**: Use your logs and unit tests to debug the code.
**Optimization**: Once the basic version is working, look for optimization opportunities in terms of code efficiency and algorithmic performance.

## Phase 6: Evaluation and Iteration
**Performance Metrics**: Decide on metrics to evaluate the performance of your Q-Learning agent (e.g., win rate, average reward).
**Iterate**: Based on performance and any bugs, iterate through Phases 4-6.

## Phase 7: Documentation and Cleanup
**Comments and Documentation**: Make sure your code is well-commented and, if possible, provide external documentation.
**Code Review**: If possible, have **someone else** review your code.

**By following this roadmap, you'll have a structured approach to developing your Q-Learning algorithm, which should make the process more manageable and efficient**
