# Integrating Q-Learning with Monte Carlo Tree Search for Tic-Tac-Toe

## Objective
To create an efficient Tic-Tac-Toe agent for a 5x5 or 7x7 board using Q-Learning integrated with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

## Components

### Q-Learning
1. **State Representation**: Represent the board state as a tuple or other hashable data structure.
2. **Action Space**: Define the possible actions (empty board positions) for each state.
3. **Q-Values**: Initialize and update Q-values for state-action pairs.
4. **Policy**: Derive the policy based on the Q-values.
5. **Training**: Train the Q-Learning agent through multiple episodes.

### Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
1. **Node Representation**: Define a tree node with state, parent, children, visit count, and value.
2. **Selection**: Use UCB1 or other algorithms to traverse the tree to a leaf node.
3. **Expansion**: Expand the leaf node by adding all possible child nodes.
4. **Simulation**: Simulate a random game from the leaf node to a terminal state.
5. **Backpropagation**: Update the value and visit count of all nodes along the path from the leaf to the root.

### Integration
1. **Initialization**: Initialize the MCTS tree with the root as the current board state.
2. **Action Selection**: Use Q-Learning to select an action, but use MCTS for states where Q-Learning is uncertain.
3. **Tree Update**: After each move, update the MCTS tree to have the new board state as the root.
4. **Policy Update**: Periodically update the Q-Learning policy based on the MCTS simulations.
5. **Efficiency**: Use the Q-values as prior knowledge to guide the MCTS simulations.

## Steps

1. **Preparation**
    - Create classes and functions for Q-Learning and MCTS components.

2. **Training Phase**
    - Train the Q-Learning model through multiple episodes.
    - Optionally, run MCTS simulations to refine the Q-Learning policy.

3. **Gameplay Phase**
    - Use the trained Q-Learning model to select actions.
    - Use MCTS for additional decision-making support, especially for unfamiliar states.

4. **Evaluation**
    - Test the agent against random or pre-defined strategies.
    - Measure performance metrics like win rate, draw rate, and loss rate.

5. **Optimization**
    - Fine-tune parameters like exploration rate, learning rate, and MCTS simulation count for better performance.

6. **Testing**
    - Test the integrated agent on 5x5 and 7x7 Tic-Tac-Toe boards.

## Challenges and Considerations
- Handling the increased complexity of larger boards (5x5, 7x7).
- Balancing the trade-off between Q-Learning and MCTS for action selection.
- Efficiently updating the MCTS tree and Q-Learning policy during gameplay.
