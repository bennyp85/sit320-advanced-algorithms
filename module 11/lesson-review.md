Flow algorithms are used to solve problems that can be represented as a network of nodes and edges. 
Networks can be represented by the use of directed graphs. In this module we were given two tasks to complete. The first task was to implement Karger's algorithm with the addition of weighted edges. The second was to implement the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find the maximum flow in a network. I will demostrate that finding the maximum flow in a network is equivalent to finding the minimum cut of a network. Where disconnection of a network is having two nodes that are not connected by any path.

## Problem 1: Karger's Algorithm with Weighted Edges

### Problem Statement
If we are presented with a network that includes weighted edges how would we modify Karger's algorithm to find the minimum cut of the network?
Karger's algorithm is a randomized algorithm that can be used to find the minimum cut of a network. 
The minimum cut is the smallest number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the network.
If we are sucessful in finding the minimum cut, there will be a set S of edges(v, w) with v in P and w in P'.
The sum of the weights of the edges in S is the capacity of the cut.

### Assumptions
We can assume that all edge weights are non-negative intergers and are chosen randomly from the range [1, 10].
The graph will be connected and not contain any self-loops.

### Solution
I will be going off the asumption that **90% correct** is an acceptable accuracy for the algorithm.
This value was chosen as it is very close to one iteration(!) of the Kargers4 algorithm.
I ran the first two algorithms **(n * (n - 1) / 2 * log(1 / 0.1)) times** and returned the minimum cut found.
1. Karger's with random edge weights and contraction chosen probabilistically -> SLOW O(n^4) and ACCURATE with high number of iterations
2. Karger's with no edge weights and contraction chosen randomly -> SLOW O(n^4) and ACCURATE with high number of iterations
3. Recursive version of Karager's with the no edge weights -> FAST O(n^2 log^3 n) and ACCURATE with ONE iteration

I chose to implment a **probabilistic version** of Karger's algorithm with weighted edges as my solution to the task. I was originally puzzled about how weights could help us find the minimum cut of a network with Karger's algorith. I was fixated on the idea that I **needed to know** with some certainty **where** the minimum cut was. Karger's finds edges to contract randomly and my solution to implement probabilities to chose an edge to contract is essentially doing the same thing.


### Key Take aways
I believe that the idea of this task was a way to lead us to the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. Adding weights to Karger's algorithm did not lead to any insights, but rather allowed me to appriciate the ideas presented in the next task. I feel as if we posses the knowledge of where the minimum cut is, we can manipulate the weights of the edges closest to find thesolution more efficiently. There have been improvements in Karger's algorithm, and I attempted to implement these improvments. *see Kargers4* in the notebook.

### Randomised Algorithms
Karger's is an example of a monte carlo algorithm. It is a randomized algorithm in the sense that it uses randomisation to decide what to do next. To find a solution with any certainty, the algorithm must be run multiple times. The algorithm is **probabilistic** as it has a chance of returning an incorrect solution. Randomised algorithms present a facinating idea that we can use randomness to find efficient *good-enough* solutions to difficult problems.

## Problem 2: Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

### Problem Statement
Prove that finding the maximum flow in a network is equivalent to finding the minimum cut of a network.
The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is a greedy algorithm that can be used to find the maximum flow in a network. 
The maximum flow is the maximum amount of flow that can be pushed through the network from the source to the sink.

### Solution
My solution to this problem was to first implment the Graph and Node classes. These laid the foundation for the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. I created edge, weights and flow dictionaries in the Graph class. This class also had methods to update the flow and find the path. The Node class simply contained a data field and a neighbors list. I also found it useful to create a specific Residual Graph class. The reason for this was that it was awkward to reverse the edges of the original graph. This class also contained a method to update the weights in the residual graph.
The main algorithm was comprised of four helper methods; *is_reachable*, *get_path*, *increase_flow* and *print_min_cut*. 
I also crated a *Ford_Fulkerson* function that called these helper methods. 

The steps to find the min_cut and prove that it is equivalent to the max_flow are as follows:
```pseudo
1. Create a graph and its residual graph
2. Call the Ford_Fulkerson function
    2a. Set the max_flow to 0
    2b. While there is a path from source to sink
        2b1. Find the path
    2c. Set the flow to the minimum of the weights in residual graph from the path
    2d. Update the flow in the graph
    2e. Update the weights in the residual graph
    2f. Add the flow to the max_flow
    2g. Return the max_flow
3. Find all nodes reachable from the source in the residual graph
    3a. Add the nodes to a visited set
    3b. Add the neighbors of the nodes to a queue
4. Set min_cut to 0
    4a. Loop through the visited set
    4b. Loop through the neighbors of the node in the residual graph
    4c. If the neighbor is not in the visited set
    4d. Add the weight of the edge in the residual graph between the neighbor and the node to the min_cut
5. Print the min_cut and max_flow
```

### Key Take aways
The min-cut in a network is equal to the max flow. This is because the max flow is the maximum amount of flow that can be pushed through the network from the source to the sink, while the min-cut is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the network. The min-cut is the sum of the weights of the edges that are removed, and the max flow is the sum of the weights of the edges that are not removed. These ideas have a variety of use cases. From organising transportation networks to distributing oil through refinery pipelines, the max flow and min-cut is a useful and efficient way to solve these problems.
###  Idea behind the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
Let P be a path from source to sink in a flow network G. We need to satisfy the following conditions:
- For each properly oriented edge (u,v) in P, we have Flow(u,v) < Capacity(u,v)
- For each properly oriented edge (u, v) in P, we have Flow(u,v) > 0

Let delta be the minimum of the differences Capacity(u,v) - Flow(u,v) over all **properly oriented** edges (u,v) in P. 
```
               | Flow(u, v),            if (u, v) is not in P 
Flow*(u, v) =  | Flow(u, v) + delta,    if (u, v) is in P and properly oriented
               | Flow(u, v) - delta,    if (u, v) is in P and improperly oriented
```
Since the edge (u,v) in P is increased by delta, the value of Flow*(u,v) is delta greater than the value of Flow(u,v) before the augmentation.
