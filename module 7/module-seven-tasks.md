### SIT320 — Advanced Algorithms
#### School of Information Technology, Deakin University
#### Pass Task 7 — Dynamic Programming
#### About this Task

**(0) Overview of Learning:**
  - Summarize what you have learned from the lecture (seminar), module content on cloud Deakin, interaction with Unit Chair/Tutors/Peers, research in the library or the internet, and interaction with chatGPT. Include specific prompts if used.

**(1) Running Up a Staircase:**
  - You have a staircase with n steps and can hop 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time.
  - Write a Dynamic Programming (DP) program to find how many possible ways you can run up the stairs.
  - Start with a recursive solution and then move to a top-down DP approach.

**(2) Longest Common Sub-sequence:**
  - Write code to find the Longest Common Sub-sequence.
  - Output both the Matrix C and the longest sub-sequence.
  - Test the algorithms with various test cases.

**(3) 0/1 Knapsack:**
  - Given the code for unbounded knapsack, implement a solution for the 0/1 Knapsack problem.
  - Test the algorithms with various test cases.

#### Task List
At the completion of Module 7 (Dynamic Programming), you are required to:
  - Fill a lesson review including the above activities.
  - Your tutor will review your submission and provide feedback.
  - If incomplete, you may be asked to include missing parts or clarify understanding through follow-up questions.
