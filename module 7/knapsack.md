### 0/1 Knapsack Problem

The 0/1 Knapsack problem is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem. It's named "0/1" because for each item, you either take it (1) or leave it (0), unlike the fractional knapsack problem where you can take a fraction of an item.

#### 1. Problem Statement:
- **Given:**
  - A set of `n` items, each with a weight `w[i]` and a value `v[i]`.
  - A knapsack with a maximum weight capacity `W`.
- **Find:**
  - The combination of items to include in the knapsack so that the total weight doesn't exceed `W`, and the total value is maximized.

#### 2. Dynamic Programming Solution:
- **Step 1:** Create a table `K` where `K[i][w]` will store the maximum value that can be achieved using the first `i` items, considering a total weight `w`.
- **Step 2:** Initialize the first row and first column to 0.
- **Step 3:** Iterate through the items and weights, and fill in the table according to the following rules:
  - If `w[i] <= w`, then `K[i][w] = max(v[i] + K[i-1][w-w[i]], K[i-1][w])`.
  - Otherwise, `K[i][w] = K[i-1][w]`.
- **Step 4:** The value `K[n][W]` will be the maximum value for the knapsack of weight `W`.

#### 3. Complexity:
- Time Complexity: `O(n * W)`, where `n` is the number of items and `W` is the maximum weight capacity.
- Space Complexity: `O(n * W)` for storing the table `K`.

#### 4. Example:
Consider items with weights `[2, 3, 4]` and values `[3, 4, 5]`, and a knapsack capacity of `5`. The maximum value is `7`, achieved by selecting the first two items.

#### 5. Applications:
- Resource allocation in project management.
- Budget allocation in finance.
- Selection problems in various domains.

#### Conclusion:
The 0/1 Knapsack problem is a central problem in optimization and algorithm design. Its solution using dynamic programming illustrates the principles of optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems. It has applications in various fields and is often used as a stepping stone to more complex algorithmic challenges.
