### Glossary of Terms

#### 1. **Dynamic Programming (DP):**
   - A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems and storing their solutions.

#### 2. **Overlapping Subproblems:**
   - A property where the same subproblems are solved multiple times. In DP, solutions to these are stored to avoid redundant computations.

#### 3. **Optimal Substructure:**
   - A property where the optimal solution of a problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.

#### 4. **Bottom-Up Approach (Tabulation):**
   - A DP approach that starts from the simplest subproblem and builds up the solution.

#### 5. **Top-Down Approach (Memoization):**
   - A DP approach that begins with the complex problem, breaking it into subproblems, and storing solutions.

#### 6. **Longest Common Sub-sequence (LCS):**
   - Finding the longest sequence of characters that appear in the same order within two sequences.

#### 7. **0/1 Knapsack Problem:**
   - A combinatorial optimization problem to maximize value, given a set of items with weights and values and a maximum weight capacity.

#### 8. **Matrix C (in LCS):**
   - A table used in LCS to store the lengths of common sub-sequences.

#### 9. **Table K (in 0/1 Knapsack):**
   - A table used in the 0/1 Knapsack problem to store the maximum values for different weights.

#### 10. **Time Complexity:**
   - A measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input.

#### 11. **Space Complexity:**
   - A measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input.

#### 12. **Combinatorial Optimization:**
   - The study of finding the best, or optimal, object from a finite set of objects, often with constraints.

#### 13. **Subsequence:**
   - A sequence that appears in the same relative order but not necessarily consecutively.

#### 14. **Optimization Problem:**
   - A problem that seeks to find the best solution from all feasible solutions.
