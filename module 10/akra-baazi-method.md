### Akra-Bazzi Method

#### Steps to Solve Using Akra-Bazzi
1. **Find p**: Solve for p in the equation: Sum `(a_i * b_i^p) = 1 for i = 1 to k`
2. **Calculate Integral**: Compute the integral from `1 to n of (g(u)/u^p)` with respect to `u`
3. **Combine Results**: The solution for T(n) is then given by:
   - `T(n) = Theta(n^p + integral from 1 to n of (g(u)/u^p))` with respect to `u`

#### Example
Consider the recurrence relation:
`T(n) = T(n/2) + T(n/3) + n`

1. **Find p**: Solve `(1/2^p + 1/3^p = 1)`, which gives `(p â‰ˆ 0.7095)`.
2. **Calculate Integral**: Compute the integral from `1 to n of (u/u^0.7095)` with respect to `u`.
3. **Combine Results**: The solution is:
   `T(n) = Theta(n^0.7095 + integral from 1 to n of (u/u^0.7095))` with respect to `u`

#### Conclusion
The Akra-Bazzi method is a powerful tool for analyzing complex recurrence relations. It provides a generalized way to analyze such recurrences, particularly for divide-and-conquer algorithms where the subproblems may be of unequal size.
