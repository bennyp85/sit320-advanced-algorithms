# Quicksort Algorithm Analysis

## Introduction
Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that uses a pivot to partition an array into two sub-arrays. Quicksort has significant importance because it's one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. Common use cases include database sorting, search engine algorithms, and data analytics.

### Key Features
Key features of Quicksort are in-place sorting, it's admirable time complexity, the various ways to choose a pivot, unfortunate non-stable sort, adaptive in terms of being able to sort partial lists, parallelizable, language agnostic, that there are randomized versions, it's practicality and being able to sort any set of items that can be compared.

## Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity

#### Best Case
Best case for Quicksort is \(O(n \log n)\). Explain why this is the case.

#### Average Case
Average case for Quicksort is \(O(n \log n)\). Explain why this is the case.

#### Worst Case
Worst case for Quicksort is \(O(n^2)\). Explain why this is the case.

### Space Complexity
Quicksort is an in-place sorting algorithm. This means that it doesn't require any additional memory to sort the array. 

## Variants of Quicksort

### Randomized Quicksort
Explain how using a random pivot can affect the algorithm's performance.

### Meadian-of-Three Quicksort
Explain how using the median-of-three method to select the pivot can affect the algorithm's performance.

## Ethical Considerations

### Computational Efficiency
Discuss the implications of algorithmic efficiency in broader contexts, such as energy consumption.

### Fairness and Bias
Explore any ethical concerns related to the algorithm, if applicable.

## Comparisons with Other Algorithms
Compare Quicksort with other sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc., in terms of performance and application suitability.
