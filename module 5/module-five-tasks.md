### Module 5: Graphs I - Task Overview

**Tasks to Complete:**

**(0) Learning Overview:**  
- Provide a short summary based on:  
  - Learning from lecture (seminar).
  - Module content on Cloud Deakin.
  - Interaction with Unit Chair/Tutors/Peers.
  - Personal research (library or internet).
  - Interaction with chatGPT (record and provide the prompts used).

**(1) Bidirectional Search Algorithm:**  
- Understand the bidirectional search and its application in finding the shortest path.
- Design an algorithm for bidirectional search.
- Implement the algorithm in this week's ipynb.

**(2) BFS for Bipartite Graph:**  
- Design an algorithm using BFS to determine if a graph is bipartite.
- Modify the BFS code from this week's lab book to fit the new algorithm.
- Implement the designed algorithm.

**(3) Strongly Connected Components (SCC):**  
- Understand the definition of a strongly connected component from Cloud Deakin.
- Write an algorithm to find the SCCs in a graph.
- Extend the given Node and Graph code to implement this algorithm.

**Post-Module Activities:**  
- Upon completion of the module, fill out a lesson review.
- Submit for feedback from the tutor.
- Address any missing parts or clarifications as mentioned by the tutor.
