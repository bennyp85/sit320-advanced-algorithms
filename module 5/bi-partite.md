## Key Terms and Concepts:

### Bipartite Graph:
- **Definition:** A graph where nodes can be divided into two distinct sets so that every edge connects a node from one set to a node from the other set.
- **Visualization:** A bipartite graph can be visualized with two sets of nodes, for instance, one colored red and the other colored orange. No edge exists between nodes of the same color.

### Importance of Determining Bipartite Nature:
- **Example:** When buying fish of different species, some species may fight if kept in the same tank. If the fish species relations can be represented as a bipartite graph, then they can be separated into two tanks where no two species in the same tank will fight.
  
### Algorithm to Check for Bipartite:
- **Use of BFS:** To determine if a graph is bipartite, a BFS can be modified.
- **Modification:** Nodes are colored alternately as BFS explores the graph. If no two adjacent nodes have the same color by the end of the BFS, then the graph is bipartite. Otherwise, it's not.

### Miscellaneous Information:
- **Challenge:** While small graphs can be visually inspected, larger graphs require algorithmic methods to determine if they are bipartite.
