## Glossary of Terms for Module 5: Graphs I

- **Graph:** A collection of nodes (or vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes.
  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** An algorithm for traversing or searching graph structures, starting from a root and exploring the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

- **Bidirectional Search:** An algorithm that finds the shortest path from a source node to a target node by simultaneously running two BFSs, one from the source and the other from the target, until they meet.
  
- **Bipartite Graph:** A graph whose nodes can be divided into two distinct sets such that no two nodes within the same set are adjacent.
  
- **Strongly Connected Component (SCC):** In a directed graph, an SCC is a subgraph where there is a path from each node to every other node. It represents a maximal set of vertices where each pair of vertices is mutually reachable.
  
- **Node/Vertex:** An individual point in a graph.

- **Edge:** A line connecting two nodes in a graph indicating a relationship between them.

- **Path:** A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a starting node to a destination node.

- **Depth:** The level or distance from the root node in a graph.

- **Algorithm:** A step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.
