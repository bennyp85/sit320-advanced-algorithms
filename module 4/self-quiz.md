## Recursion
---
- **Definition**: How would you define recursion in the context of computer programming?
- **Base Case**: Why is a base case essential in a recursive function?
- **Stack Overflow**: What is a stack overflow error in the context of recursion, and how can it occur?
- **Tail Recursion**: What is tail recursion and how is it different from regular recursion? Why is it considered more efficient in some contexts?
- **Use Cases**: Can you name a few problems or algorithms where recursion is particularly useful?
- **Iteration vs. Recursion**: How would you compare iterative solutions to recursive solutions? When might you prefer one over the other?
- **Memory Usage**: How does memory usage typically compare between recursive and iterative solutions?
- **Divide and Conquer**: How does recursion relate to the divide and conquer strategy?
- **Inductive Step**: In the context of recursion, what do you understand by the term "inductive step"
- **Examples**: Can you describe a real-world analogy or metaphor that helps explain how recursion works?

## Tree Traversal

1. **Definition**:
    - Can you define what pre-order, in-order, and post-order tree traversals are?

2. **Applications**:
    - What is a common use case for in-order traversal in a binary search tree?
    - Why might you want to use pre-order traversal when copying or cloning a tree?
    - How is post-order traversal useful in scenarios that involve freeing or deleting nodes from a tree?

3. **Sequences**:
    - Given a binary tree with the nodes in the order 1-2-3 (with 1 as the root, 2 as the left child, and 3 as the right child), what would be the pre-order, in-order, and post-order sequences?

4. **Construction**:
    - If you're given both the in-order and pre-order (or post-order) sequences of a binary tree, can you reconstruct the tree? Why or why not?

5. **Comparison**:
    - How do the traversal methods differ in terms of the order they visit the current node, left subtree, and right subtree?

6. **Iterative Approach**:
    - While these traversal methods are typically explained recursively, how might you implement them iteratively, especially using structures like stacks?

7. **Complex Trees**:
    - Consider a binary tree where each node has a value, and nodes are ordered such that for each node, values in the left subtree are less than the node and values in the right subtree are greater. How would the in-order traversal sequence look in comparison to the original node values?
