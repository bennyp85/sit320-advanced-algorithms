# Module Five Lesson Review Video Script

---

**[Intro Slide]**

"Hello, Nayyar and Kiran, welcome to the review of Module Five. Let's dive deep into the insights I've gathered from this lesson."

---

**[GitHub Repository Slide]**  
"First off, I'd like to draw your attention to the GitHub repository for this module. [Pause for 2 seconds for viewers to see the link]. I've stored all my code implementations and notes here. So, you can follow along or review the codes in detail."

---

**[UML Diagram Slide]**  
"Along with the code, I've created a UML diagram that visualizes the structure of our tree implementations.I found this a great exercise for understanding the big picture."

---

**[Binary Search Trees Slide]**  
"Let's talk about Binary Search Trees or BSTs. Here's what you need to know:"  
- "Every node has a key, and two sub-trees. We refer to them as left and right."
- "All the keys in the left sub-tree are less than the node's key, and those on the right are greater."
- "Keys are distinct, ensuring each node in the tree is unique."

---

**[Benefits of BST Slide]**  
"Why are BSTs crucial?"  
- "They are ordered structures, which means they support efficient in-order traversal."
- "They're dynamic; they can grow or shrink as required."
- "Operations like search, insertion, and deletion can be performed efficiently."

---

**[Operations on BST Slide]**  
"Key operations you can perform on a BST include:"
- "Search, where you locate a node using its key."
- "Insertion, which allows you to add a new node."
- "Deletion, used to remove a node."
- "And traversal, which lets you process all nodes in a specific sequence."

---

**[Time Complexities Slide]**  
"Speaking of efficiency, in the best-case scenario, where our BST is balanced, operations run in \(O(log n)\) time. However, in the worst case, where our BST is skewed, it's \(O(n)\)."

---

**[Drawbacks Slide]**  
"However, it's not all rosy. BSTs have their challenges:"
- "Without balancing, they can become skewed, which hampers their efficiency."
- "Trees that self-balance can sometimes have overheads due to the balancing process."

---

**[Common Ancestor Slide]**  
"Another interesting concept is finding the common ancestor in a BST. The steps are:"
1. "Search for the nodes in the BST."
2. "Then, determine their first common ancestor."

---

**[Tree Rotations Slide]**  
"In certain situations, to maintain the tree's balance or structure, we may need to perform tree rotations. The types of rotations are left, right, left-right, and right-left."

---

**[Testing Slide]**  
"Testing our trees ensures they function as expected. This involves:"
- "Checking if our tree is balanced."
- "Finding the common ancestor between two nodes."
- "And testing for various rotations."

---

**[Code Implementation Slide]**  
"For the code implementation, I chose the Strategy Design Pattern. It's a fantastic choice because:"
- "It allowed me to define a set of algorithms and make them interchangeable."
- "It made it easier to implement different balancing algorithms and rotations."

---

**[Review and Feedback Slide]**  
"As we wrap up the module, here's my personal takeaway:"
- "The Strategy Design Pattern was a challenge but worth it."
- "The concepts were clear, but implementation had its challenges."
- "Remember, when dealing with instance methods, always use SELF!"
- "I wish I could have interacted more with fellow students. Sharing insights would have been beneficial."

---

**[Reading Recommendations Slide]**  
"If you're interested in my readings, here's the list:"
- "CLRS chapters on BSTs and Red-Black Trees."
- "Tim Roughgarden's 'Algorithms Illuminated Part 2'."
- "Richard Johnsonbaugh's 'Discrete Mathematics'."
- "And for design patterns, I dug into the 'Gang of Four Design Patterns'."

---

**[Conclusion Slide]**  
"That's a wrap for this module's review. Thank you for joining. Remember, the links to the GitHub repository, UML diagram, and more are provided in the PDF. Happy coding!"
