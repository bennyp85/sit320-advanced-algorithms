## TicTacToe Game Testing Guideline

### 1. Functionality & Game Logic:
   - Ensure that the game recognizes a win condition for all board sizes.
   - Confirm the game detects draw situations accurately.
   - Validate that the game alternates turns between players.
   - Check board updates upon each move.

### 2. User Experience & Interface:
   - Is the current player's turn clearly indicated?
   - Handle invalid inputs: occupied cells or non-numeric values.
   - Display an updated board after each move.
   - Provide clear gameplay instructions and settings choices.

### 3. Algorithm & AI Play:
   - Test the computer's decision-making with the Minimax algorithm.
   - Handle delays or errors in algorithm execution.
   - Evaluate performance with other algorithms, if any.

### 4. Configuration & Settings:
   - Switch between board sizes seamlessly.
   - Choose different algorithms and play modes smoothly.

### 5. Edge Cases & Robustness:
   - Handle moves outside board dimensions.
   - Manage unexpected game interruptions.
   - Check performance on larger board sizes.

### 6. Extendability & Modularity:
   - Gauge the ease of adding new features.
   - Test game modules independently.

### 7. Visual & Aesthetics:
   - Assess visual appeal and user interface.
   - Provide visual feedback for game outcomes.
