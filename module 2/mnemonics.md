**1. Algorithm:** 
- Mnemonic: **MPP** 
   * **M**any applications use algorithms, from mathematics to computing.
   * The **P**erformance of an algorithm matters greatly in terms of speed and resource use.
   * **P**opular examples of algorithms include sorting and searching algorithms.

**2. Code Refactoring:** 
- Mnemonic: **RIB**
   * Code refactoring improves the **R**eadability of code.
   * Changes should be **I**ncremental to avoid introducing new bugs.
   * Tests should be in place to ensure the **B**ehavior of the software remains the same.

**3. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
- Mnemonic: **FDR**
   * The Dependency Inversion Principle increases system **F**lexibility.
   * It **D**ecouples modules, making them easier to manage.
   * It **R**educes the impact of changes in low-level modules on high-level ones.

**4. Open-Closed Principle (OCP):**
- Mnemonic: **NEB**
   * With the Open-Closed Principle, use **N**ew code for extending functionality.
   * It keeps **E**xisting code safe from modification.
   * It makes **B**ugs less likely when extending functionality.

**5. Inheritance:**
- Mnemonic: **RRC**
   * Inheritance helps in the **R**eusability of code.
   * It allows us to represent **R**eal-world relationships.
   * However, **C**aution is required as misuse can make the code hard to understand and maintain.
