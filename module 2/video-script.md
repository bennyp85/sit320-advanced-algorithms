🎥 **[Opening with the title slide: "Module Two: Advanced Algorithms & Software Design"]**

🗣️ "Hello Nayyar and Kiran! Today, I want to briefly share what I've achieved and learned in the second module of our Advanced Algorithms course."

🎥 **[Slide showing the SOLID principles and software development phases]**

🗣️ "In our dive into software design, we learned the importance of using the right pattern for the job and rigorously following the SOLID principles. These principles have transformed how I approach software development. Also, I realized product development is iterative, moving between phases like analysis, design, and testing, rather than a straight path."

🎥 **[Slide showcasing UML diagrams and related terms]**

🗣️ "UML, or Unified Modeling Language, was another highlight. With its class diagrams, we gain a static view of the system. Whether it's understanding class relationships, associations and inheritance, or visualizing interactions through use case or sequence diagrams, UML has become an indispensable tool in my software design arsenal."

🎥 **[Slide on design principles, highlighting the SOLID principles with short descriptions]**

🗣️ "Going deeper into design principles, each SOLID principle brought with it an 'Aha!' moment. From the significance of a single responsibility per class to the power of dependency inversion, these principles have reshaped how I think about class design and relationships."

🎥 **[Slide showing your "Aha! Moments"]**

🗣️ "Speaking of 'Aha!' moments, realizing the usfulness of pushing common methods to parent classes gave me insights into the open-closed and Liskov substitution principles. The intricacies of Python, like its absence of interfaces, initially puzzled me. Yet, with my fellow learners, I found ways to implement principles effectively using abstract classes."

🎥 **[Slide about tasks – showing visuals of Tic Tac Toe and UML Outline]**

🗣️ "The hands-on component of tasks truly solidified my learning. I re-factored the tic-tac-toe game, ensuring safe use of inheritance. My program now supports varying board sizes and algorithms. Notably, I've made it more flexible, readable, and maintainable. Inheritance played a pivotal role, but I also appreciated the importance of when to choose composition."

🎥 **[Slide showing recommended readings with book covers]**

🗣️ "My journey was further enriched with essential readings from 'The Refactoring Guru' website, an eBook named 'Clean Code in Python', and Robert C Martin's 'Design Patterns' PDF."

🎥 **[Closing Slide: Module Two Recap with key visuals and links to your GitHub, video, and ChatGPT]**

🗣️ "To wrap up, Module Two has been transformative. From SOLID principles to hands-on refactoring, I've grown as a software designer. Please check out the links for more details and thanks for joining me in this exciting journey of continuous learning. And once again, see you next module!"
