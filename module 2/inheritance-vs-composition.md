### Inheritance vs. Composition in Tic-Tac-Toe

1. **Inheritance Basis**:
   - Did you have a "is-a" relationship between classes? Can you give an example from your code where one class "is a type of" another class?
   - Were there shared attributes or methods among various classes that made it easier to use a base class and then derive subclasses?

2. **Code Reusability**:
   - By using inheritance, did you find it easier to reuse code from the parent class in multiple child classes? 
   - Can you think of methods or attributes that were inherited and then possibly overridden or extended in subclasses?

3. **Flexibility**:
   - In what ways did inheritance provide flexibility to your design? 
   - Could you easily add new features or make changes to derived classes without modifying the base class?

4. **Composition Considerations**:
   - Why didn't you choose composition for your design? Were there specific challenges or complexities that discouraged its use?
   - How would your design look if you opted for composition over inheritance? Would it be more modular or more fragmented?

5. **Trade-offs**:
   - What are the potential downsides or challenges you faced or might face using inheritance in your Tic-Tac-Toe game design?
   - Did you encounter or foresee issues related to tight coupling, where changes in the base class might inadvertently affect the derived classes?

6. **Extensibility**:
   - Thinking about future developments, do you think using inheritance will make it easier or harder to extend your game, say by adding new features or algorithms?

7. **Readability and Maintenance**:
   - How does inheritance impact the readability of your code?
   - Does inheritance make it easier or more challenging for another developer to pick up and understand your codebase?
