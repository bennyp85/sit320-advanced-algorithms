# Mathematical Terms Related to Graphs Module

## Graph Theory Terms:

- **Graph (G)**: A collection of nodes (or vertices) and edges connecting these nodes.

- **Vertex (V)**: An individual node in a graph.

- **Edge (E)**: A connection between two vertices in a graph.

- **Directed Graph (DiGraph)**: A graph where each edge has a direction, meaning it goes from one vertex to another, not necessarily the other way around.

- **Undirected Graph**: A graph where edges have no direction; they simply connect two vertices.

- **Bipartite Graph**: A graph whose nodes can be split into two sets such that no two nodes within the same set are adjacent.

- **Strongly Connected Component (SCC)**: In a directed graph, an SCC is a subgraph in which every pair of vertices (u, v) has a path from u to v and from v to u.

- **Path**: A sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge.

- **Cycle**: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex.

## Search Algorithms:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: A graph traversal method that explores nodes level by level.

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: A graph traversal method that explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.

- **Bidirectional Search**: An algorithm that runs two simultaneous BFS, one from the source and one from the destination, to find the shortest path.

## Computational Complexity:

- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time complexity, often representing algorithms with nested loops for n elements.

## Miscellaneous:

- **Finishing Time**: In DFS, the time at which a vertex is finished being explored.
