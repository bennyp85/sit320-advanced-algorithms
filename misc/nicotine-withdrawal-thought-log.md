## Introduction

**Start Date**: (9th September 2023))  
**Purpose**: My purpose for keeping this thought log is to engage in a form of "introspective debugging." I'm aiming to monitor and evaluate the impact of specific life choices—particularly the decision to temporarily stop vaping—on my mental state, emotional well-being, and physical health. This experiment serves as a practical application of my interests in computer science, artificial intelligence, and philosophy of mind. By systematically logging my thoughts and experiences, I hope to better understand the "algorithm" behind my decision-making process. This will help me align my actions more closely with my ethical commitments and long-term goals, such as maximizing societal happiness and personal growth.
