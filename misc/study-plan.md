- **Exercise Timing**: The schedule includes exercise as part of the morning routine, but you can shift it to another time if that suits you better. Some people may prefer to break up their study sessions with physical activity.
- **Adaptation**: This is a full and engaging schedule, so pay attention to how you feel and adjust as needed. Flexibility is key, especially in accommodating unexpected events or changes in energy levels.
- **Mindful Transitions**: Give yourself a minute or two between these periods to transition mindfully. This can be as simple as taking a few deep breaths or having a mental or physical ritual that helps you shift gears.
