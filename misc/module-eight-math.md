## Activity Selection Problem: Dynamic Programming Approach

### Time Complexity Analysis

1. **Sorting Activities:** Sorting the activities by finish time.
   - Time Complexity: \( O(n log n) \)

2. **Initialization and DP Table Creation:** Creating a 1D DP table.
   - Time Complexity: \( O(n) \)

3. **Finding Last Compatible Activity:** Nested loop structure inside the main loop to find the last compatible activity.
   - Time Complexity: \( O(n^2) \) (in the given code snippet)

4. **Constructing the Solution:** Iterating over activities to construct the final solution.
   - Time Complexity: \( O(n) \)

### Overall Complexity

- The overall time complexity of the given code snippet: \( O(n^2) \)
- If binary search were used to find the last compatible activity, the overall complexity could be reduced to: \( O(n \log n) \)

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity of the algorithm (for the DP table): \( O(n) \)

### Conclusion

The given dynamic programming solution to the activity selection problem utilizes a 1D DP table and has an overall time complexity of \( O(n^2) \) due to the nested loop structure used to find the last compatible activity.
