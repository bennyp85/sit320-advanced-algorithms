### SIT320 — Advanced Algorithms
#### Module 8: Greedy Algorithms
**School of Information Technology, Deakin University**

**Pass Task 8 — Greedy Algorithms**

##### Tasks:
1. **Learning Overview**:
   - Provide a short overview of what you learned in the module.
   - Include insights from lectures, seminars, interactions with Unit Chair/Tutors/Peers, research in the library or the internet, and interaction with chatGPT (include prompts used).

2. **Activity Selection Problem**:
   - Write code for both dynamic programming and greedy algorithms for the Activity Selection problem.
   - Test with various test cases and demonstrate that you get the same results.

3. **Optimize Prim's Algorithm**:
   - You have been provided code for Prim’s algorithm; it's not optimized.
   - Re-write the code as discussed in the seminar to speed up the algorithm (this implementation will be inspired by Dijkstra’s implementation).

##### Lesson Review:
- At the completion of the module, fill a lesson review by performing the above activities.
- Your tutor will review your submission and provide feedback.
- If incomplete, you may be asked to include missing parts or answer follow-up questions to clarify or check your understanding of certain concepts.
