## Pass Task 6 — Graphs II

### **Task (0)** Provide a short overview of what you learned in the module. This includes learning summary from lecture (seminar), module content on cloud Deakin, interaction with Unit Chair/Tutors/Peers, research in the library or the internet, and interaction with chatGPT (include prompts used).
  - **Key Points:**
    - Review lecture notes and seminar materials.
    - Reflect on interactions with faculty and peers.
    - Include research from library resources and online sources.
    - Document the prompts used in interaction with chatGPT.

### **Task (1)** Modify Dijkstra's Algorithm in this week's lab to do a Bellman-Ford (BF) instead. Test if BF can handle negative weights as well as negative cycles in the graph.
  - **Key Points:**
    - Understand the differences between Dijkstra's Algorithm and Bellman-Ford.
    - Implement Bellman-Ford by modifying the existing code for Dijkstra's.
    - Create test cases with negative weights and negative cycles.
    - Analyze the behavior of the algorithm with these test cases.

### **Task (2)** Write down the algorithm for Floyd-Warshall, and implement this in this week's lab notebook. Print the shortest path between each node. Ensure that the algorithm handles negative weights and negative cycles.
  - **Key Points:**
    - Understand the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, including its handling of negative weights and cycles.
    - Implement the algorithm in the programming environment used in the lab.
    - Design test cases to validate the implementation, especially focusing on negative aspects.
    - Print the results in a comprehensible format, showing the shortest paths between nodes.
